Line arrayer is a quick way of characterising text files of arbitrary size.
In particular it akes asimple attem
The text file itsel

Later, much later, I used the base of these codes to read in a phylip file.
It's a bit cowardly in that I _do_ use the the first line with the #taxa and #columns at the top.


I use this knowledge for the indices on the alignment matrix
there's a huge advantage to this in the indices as you assign the matrix when the interleaving occurs.

Mostly might attitude to spaces was to ignore them unless they gave parsing information (seen1spa: seen first space)

I had some problems because I assigned the matrix when outisde the seen1spa conditions .. this was not so much a mistake but yes andoverisght.
